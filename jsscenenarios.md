   - Implement a method to update the population of a specific species.

3. **Weather Data Objects:**

   - Design objects to store weather data for different Kenyan cities.
   - Include properties for temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
   - Implement a method to find the city with the highest temperature.

4. **Maasai Mara Safari Array:**

   - Create an array representing a sequence of activities during a safari in the Maasai Mara.
   - Use array methods to modify the sequence, adding, removing, or rearranging activities.

5. **Economic Indicators Objects:**

   - Design objects to store economic indicators for Kenyan counties.
   - Include properties for GDP, unemployment rate, and poverty rate.
